### 3. Fixed Board Tests
- Simplified tests to match actual component implementation
- Removed tests for non-existent features (loading, error states, add column)
- Added proper test utilities usage

### 4. Enhanced TaskCard Tests

- Fixed type definitions for styled-components
- Improved provider setup for consistent testing

## Areas for Future Improvement

### High Priority
1. **Column.tsx Drag/Drop Coverage** (Currently 37%)
   - Add integration tests for drag over events
   - Test drop position calculations
   - Test drag between columns

2. **DragContext.tsx** (Currently 26%)
   - Add unit tests for drag context providers
   - Test drag state management
   - Test drag event handlers

### Medium Priority
3. **Theme Coverage** (Currently 33%)
   - Add tests for theme switching
   - Test theme utility functions

4. **Storage Utilities** (Currently 53%)
   - Add tests for localStorage interactions
   - Test error handling in storage operations

5. **Throttle Utility** (Currently 23%)
   - Add unit tests for throttle function
   - Test timing and debounce behavior

## Test Best Practices Followed

✅ Use proper test isolation
✅ Mock external dependencies appropriately
✅ Test user interactions, not implementation details
✅ Use meaningful test descriptions
✅ Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
✅ Avoid brittle selectors
✅ Test edge cases and error scenarios
✅ Keep tests focused and single-purpose

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage
npm test -- --coverage

# Run specific test file
npm test -- FilterBar.test.tsx

# Run tests in watch mode
npm test -- --watch
```

## Coverage Goals

- ✅ Critical Components (Board, FilterBar, Slices): 100%
- ✅ UI Components (TaskCard): > 90%
- ⚠️ Complex Components (Column with drag/drop): 37% (Target: > 70%)
- ⚠️ Context Providers: 26% (Target: > 60%)
- ⚠️ Utilities: 23-53% (Target: > 70%)

## Conclusion

The test suite provides solid coverage for core functionality with all 45 tests passing. The application's critical features (board management, filtering, task CRUD operations) are well-tested. Future work should focus on improving coverage for drag-and-drop interactions and utility functions.
